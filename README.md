## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

* **Angular 18+** with **Standalone Components**
* **Syncfusion Scheduler** (`@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule`)[Demo](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/?_gl=1*1bin2th*_ga*MzQ5MTgxMzE3LjE3NTMyNzkxMzI.*_ga_41J4HFMX1J*czE3NTMyNzkxMzEkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTMyNzkyOTUkajYwJGwwJGgw#/bootstrap5/schedule/adaptive-rows)
* **Bootstrap 5** (for responsive layout)
* **SCSS** (modular component styling)
* **Signal-based State Management** (`@angular/core`)
* **Toastr** (`ngx-toastr`) for user notifications

## ðŸ§  Key Decisions & Assumptions

* The **TimelineDay** view is used to show reservations per table.
* Tables are defined as **resources** and grouped visually.
* Reservations are dynamically assigned to the most suitable table based on:

  * Availability (no time overlap)
  * Sufficient capacity (nearest fit)
* Data is managed using `signal` and `computed()` via `PlannerService`.
* Table and reservation creation use **modal dialogs**.
* Start/End times are stored as **ISO strings** and transformed to `Date` objects for Syncfusion rendering.
* Scheduler integration guided with help from ChatGPT.
* Stylesheet from Syncfusion is loaded via CDN:
